Hi!, my name is [**Jesus Ordosgoitty**](https://jodaz.xyz), a 98' born guy full-stack software developer from Venezuela 🇻🇪. I am doing freelance work for local companies and organizations but I do remote work 🏝️ for clients overseas. 

I develop applications using Laravel and Node.js, with Postgres, MongoDB and React.js. I like to think of myself as a polyglot programmer 🌐 and I'm open to other technologies as well.
