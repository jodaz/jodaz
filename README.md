My name is **Jesus Ordosgoitty**, I'm a 98' guy full-stack software developer from Venezuela 🇻🇪. I am doing freelance work form local companies and organizations but I do remote work 🏝️. 

I develop applications using Flask, Laravel and Node.js, with Postgres, MongoDB and React.js. I like to think of myself as a polyglot programmer 🌐 and I'm open to other technologies as well.
